- ``docs/Makefile``
- ``ez_setup.py``
- ``packagename/conftest.py``
- ``setup.py``
- ``setup.cfg`` (if using entry points)

In addition, astropy-helpers should be updated to v1.1.2 and the
``ah_bootstrap.py`` file should be updated to match the version in
``astropy-helpers``.

Finally, the following files have been updated, but don't necessarily need to
be updated since they will likely be heavily customized in affiliated packages:

- ``.travis.yml``
- ``appveyor.yml``
