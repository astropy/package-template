Affiliated Package Template Instructions
========================================

If you run into any problems, don't hesitate to ask for help on the
astropy-dev mailing list!

This package provides a template for packages that are affiliated with the
`Astropy`_ project. This package design mirrors the layout of the main
`Astropy`_ repository, as well as reusing much of the helper code used to
organize `Astropy`_.  The instructions below describe how to take this
template and adjust it for your particular affiliated package.

Everywhere below that the text ``yourpkg`` is shown, replace it with the name
of your particular package.

**Note**: The instructions below assume you are using git for version control,
as is used by the Astropy repository. If this is not the case, hopefully it
will be clear from context what to do with your particular VCS.

* Make sure `Astropy`_ is installed, as the template depends in part on
  Astropy to do its setup.

* You may have already done this if you are looking at this file locally, but
  if not, you will need to obtain a copy of the package template.  Assuming
  you have `git`_ installed, just do::

      git clone git://github.com/astropy/package-template.git yourpkg

  This will download the latest version of the template from `github`_ and
  place it in a directory named ``yourpkg``.

* Go into the directory you just created, and open the ``setup.py`` file
  with your favorite text editor.  Follow the steps below to update it for
  your new package.

  1. Change the ``PACKAGENAME`` variable to whatever you decide your package
     should be named (for examples' sake, we will call it ``yourpkg``). By
     tradition/very strong suggestion, python package names should be all
     lower-case.
  2. Change the ``DESCRIPTION`` variable to a short (one or few sentence)
     description of your package.
  3. Define a longer description as a string in the ``LONG_DESCRIPTION``
     variable.  You may want this to be the docstring of your package itself
     as Astropy does.  In this case, simple add ``import yourpkg`` somewhere
     above, and set ``LONG_DESCRIPTION = yourpkg.__doc__``.  Alternatively,
     you may omit the description by deleting the variable and deleting the
     line where it is used in the ``setup()`` function further down.
  4. Add your name and email address by changing the ``AUTHOR`` and
     ``AUTHOR_EMAIL`` variables.
  5. If your affiliated package has a website, change ``URL`` to point to that
     site.  Otherwise, you can leave it pointing to `Astropy`_ or just
     delete it.
  6. Exit out of your text editor

* Now tell git to remember the changes you just made::

   git add setup.py
   git commit -m "adjusted setup.py for new project yourpkg"

* Decide what license you want to use to release your source code. If you
  don't care and/or are fine with the Astropy license, just edit the file
  ``licenses/LICENSE.rst`` with your name (or your collaboration's name) at
  the top as the licensees.  Otherwise, make sure to replace that file with
  whatever license you prefer, and update the ``LICENSE`` variable in
  ``setup.py`` to reflect your choice of license.  You also may need to
  update the comment at the top of ``packagename/__init__.py`` to reflect your
  choice of license. Again, tell git about your changes::

    git add licenses/LICENSE.rst
    git add setup.py  # if you changed the license and modified setup.py
    git commit -m "updated license for new project yourpkg"

* Take a moment to look over the ``packagename/example_mod.py``,
  ``packagename/tests/test_example.py``, ``scripts/script_example``, and
  ``packagename/example_c.pyx`` files, as well as the
  ``packagename/example_subpkg`` directory. These are examples of a
  pure-python module, a test script, an example command-line script, a
  `Cython`_ module, and a sub-package, respectively. (`Cython`_ is a way to
  compile python-like code to C to make it run faster - see the project's web
  site for details). These are provided as examples of standard way to lay
  these out. Once you understand these, though, you'll want to delete them
  (and later replace with your own)::

    git rm packagename/example_mod.py
    git rm scripts/script_example
    git rm packagename/example_c.pyx
    git rm packagename/tests/test_example.py
    git rm -r packagename/example_subpkg
    git commit -m "removed examples from package template"

* Now rename the source code directory to match your project's name::

    git mv packagename yourpkg
    git commit -m "renamed template package source to new project yourpkg"

* Adjust the information in the documentation to match your new project by
  editing the ``docs/conf.py`` file.

  1. Change the ``project`` variable to your project's name (note that this 
     does not *need* to be exactly the same as the package name, but that's a
     common convention).
  2. Update the ``author`` variable with your name or the name of your collaboration.
  3. Update the ``copyright`` variable for the current year.
  4. Change the following lines::

        import packagename
        # The short X.Y version.
        version = packagename.__version__.split('-', 1)[0]
        # The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags.
        release = packagename.__version__

     to::

        import yourpkg
        # The short X.Y version.
        version = yourpkg.__version__.split('-', 1)[0]
        # The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags.
        release = yourpkg.__version__

     where ``yourpkg`` is the name of your package.
  5. (optional) If you're hosting your source code on github, you can
     enable a sphinx extension that will link documentation pages 
     directly to github's web site. To do this, uncomment the code in 
     the "edit_on_github" section at the bottom of ``docs/conf.py``, 
     and replace ``packagename`` and ``reponame`` in that section with
     the name of your package and github repository.
  

* Pass these changes on to git::

    git add docs/conf.py
    git commit -m "updated documentation for new project yourpkg"

* Update the names of the documentation files to match your package's name.
  First open ``docs/index.rst`` in a text editor and change the text
  ``"packagename/index.rst"`` to e.g., ``"yourpkg/index.rst"``.  Then do::

    git add docs/index.rst
    git mv docs/packagename docs/yourpkg
    git commit -m "Updated docs to reflect new project yourpkg"

* Adjust the ``MANIFEST.in`` file to reflect your package's name by changing
  the line 4 from ``recursive-include packagename *.pyx *.c`` to
  ``recursive-include yourpkg *.pyx *.c`` and pass this onto git::

    ... edit MANIFEST.in as described above...
    git add MANIFEST.in
    git commit -m "updated MANIFEST.in for new project yourpkg"

* Edit this file (``README.rst``) and delete all of this content, and replace it
  with a short description of your affiliated package. Inform git::

    git add README.rst
    git commit -m "replaced README for new project yourpkg"

* (This step assumes your affiliated package is hosted as part of the astropy
  organization on Github.  If it's instead hosted somewhere else, just adjust
  the URL in the instructions below to match wherever your repository lives)
  Now you will want to tell git that it should be pushing and pulling updates
  to the repository of *your* project, rather than the package template::

    git remote rename origin template
    git remote add upstream git@github.com:astropy/yourpkg.git

  Now that it is pointing to the correct master, you should push everything up
  to your project and make sure that your local master is tied to your project
  rather than the template.  You'll only be able to do this if your github
  repository is empty (if not, add the ``-f`` option to the ``push``
  command - that will overwrite whatever is there)::

    git push upstream master
    git branch master --set-upstream upstream/master

* (optional) If you are adopting the standard workflow used by `Astropy`_ with
  github, you will also want to set up a fork of the repo on your own account,
  by going to the Github page https://github.com/astropy/yourpkg and clicking
  the "fork" button on the upper right.  Then run the following commands::

    git remote add origin git@github.com:yourgithubusername/yourpkg.git
    git branch master --set-upstream origin/master

  Now you can push, pull, and branch whatever you want in your local fork
  without affecting the official version, but when you want to push something
  up to the main repository, just switch to the appropriate branch and do
  ``git push upstream master``.

* You should register your package on https://travis-ci.org and modify the
  ``.travis.yml`` file to make the build pass. This will continuously test
  your package for each commit, even pull requests against your main repository
  will be automatically tested, so that you notice when something breaks.
  For further information see
  `here <https://github.com/astropy/astropy/wiki/Continuous-Integration>`_
  and for lot's of example ``.travis.yml`` build configurations see
  `here <https://github.com/astropy/astropy/wiki/travis-ci-test-status>`_.
  Generally you should aim to always have you `master` branch work with
  the latest stable as well as the latest development version of astropy
  (i.e. the astropy git master branch).

* You're now ready to start doing actual work on your affiliated package.  You
  will probably want to read over the developer guidelines of the Astropy
  documentation, and if you are hosting your code in GitHub, you might also
  want to read the `Github help <http://help.github.com/>`_ to ensure you know
  how to push your code to GitHub and some recommended workflows that work for
  the core Astropy project.

* Once you have started work on the affiliated package, you should register
  your package with the Astropy affiliated package registry. Instructions for
  doing this will be provided on the `Astropy`_ website.

* Good luck with your code and your science!
